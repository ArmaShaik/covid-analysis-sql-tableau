# Data Technology: COVID-19 Impact on U.S. Fast-Food Franchises

This project analyzes how the COVID-19 pandemic affected the operations of top U.S. fast-food chains using SQL and Tableau. Working with datasets from Yelp and Kaggle, we explored franchise unit changes, consumer behavior, and brand-level impact to derive actionable insights.
